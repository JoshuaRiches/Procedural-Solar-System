# Procedural-Solar-System
This is a project I'm currently working on where the aim is to create a system in the Unity engine where you can, at the click of a button, create a random solar system made up of a star and planets, where the planets all have procedural terrain around their surface. 

​

The data of each planet will be determined by choosing a random planet from the NASA exo-planet database (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS)

and the appearance will be determined by the temperature of the planet and how Earth-like the planet is.

​

A user running the program should be able to click on a planet and focus in on it with the camera following the planet until the user selects another planet or presses a key to stop following the planet. 

​

A possible extended aim of the project is to allow the user to manually change the settings of a planet to tweak it more to their liking and the system will automatically readjust the orbit of the planet appropriately.
